      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine frozen blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice for jam in a
            small pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring
            occasionally, until mixture has reduced and thickened, about 12
            minutes. Remove from the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve, pressing solids to extract
            as much jam as possible; you should have approximately 1/4 cup.
            Discard any solids and refrigerate jam until completely cool, at
            least 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin
            cups with paper liners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt for cupcakes together in a
            small bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cream sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and
            fluffy. Mix in lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla until combined.
            Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with buttermilk, beating
            batter just until combined after each addition; batter will be
            somewhat thick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place frozen blueberries in a small bowl and toss with flour until
            coated. Add to the batter and fold to incorporate. Spoon batter into
            the prepared muffin cups, filling each one 3/4 full.
          </li>
        </ol>
